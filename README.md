An integrated approach for spliced leader detection and operon prediction in eukaryotes using long RNA reads 

## Workflow

 **(A)** A flow chart illustrates the direct RNA sequencing procedure of the species with the spliced leader and trans-splicing mechanism. SL RNA joins to pre-mRNA through trans-splicing, adding an SL sequence to the 5′ end. This forms a mature mRNA with the SL sequence, which is then sequenced using Nanopore sequencing. Long RNA reads were mapped to genome reference. 
 **(B)** A flow chart illustrates the workflow of the function of SL detection using SLRanger. After long RNA reads are mapped to reference, the 5’ unaligned end sequences will be extracted for alignment to SL sequence references and random sequences (as control). Based on the scoring system produced by SLRanger, we obtained the “SL score” on the possibility that one read has an SL sequence and the distribution of different SL types. 
 **(C)** The plot of the principle on how SLRanger predicts operon. Based on the information of whether each read has a high-confident SL sequence, we predict the operon structure through the mapping information of each read and the relative position of the gene. A high proportion of reads of the SL1 type will be regarded as operon upstream genes, while a high proportion of SL2 type reads or multiple reads supported by SL2 types will be regarded as operon downstream genes.

## Installation
 The pipeline is invoked using a CLI written in **Python(3.9-3.11)** and requires a Unix-based operating system. For conda method, we provided installation from pypi and git
###  i. Conda method
1. Prepare a new conda env
```
conda create -n SLRanger_env python=3.9
conda activate SLRanger_env
conda install -c bioconda bedtools minimap2 samtools
```
2a. Install from **PyPI**  
```
# install from pypi
pip install SLRanger
```
2b. Install from **Github**
```
#  install from git
git clone https://github.com/lrslab/SLRanger.git
cd SLRanger/
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
###  ii. Docker method
```
docker pull zhihaguo/slranger_env
```
##  Manual 
SLRanger encompasses two primary functions, spliced leader (SL) detection and operon prediction, used to determine whether long RNA reads carry SL sequences and predict the operon structure based on the SL information.
### 1. Preprocessing
#### Reference and annotation selection 
The long RNA reads will be mapped to the genome reference. The genome reference (**fasta/fa/fna** file) and annotation file (**GFF** file) should be determined before running SLRanger.
These can be downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/) or assembled independently.

In our sample folder,we provided _C. elegans_ annotation file.
#### Long reads alignment
Additionally, we require users to provide their own alignment file (**BAM** file). For long reads, minimap2 is the recommended software. 
In the sample folder, we have provided **test.bam**, which was generated using the following command.
```
minimap2 -ax splice -uf -t 80 -k14 --MD --secondary=no $reference $basecall_file > tmp.sam
samtools view -hbS tmp.sam | samtools sort -@ 32 -F 260 -o test.bam
samtools index test.bam
```
### 2. Spliced Leader detection
`SL_detect.py` is designed to detect spliced leaders. 
#### Command options
Available options can be viewed by running `SL_detect.py -h` in the command line.
```
SL_detect.py -h
usage: SL_detect.py [-h] -r REF -b BAM [-o OUTPUT] [--visualization] [-t CPU]

help to know spliced leader and distinguish SL1 and SL2

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REF, --ref REF     SL reference (fasta file recording SL sequence, required)
  -b BAM, --bam BAM     input the bam file (required)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file (default: SLRanger.txt)
  --visualization       Turn on the visualization mode
  -t CPU, --cpu CPU     CPU number (default: 4)
```

####  Example
We provided test data to run as below.
```
git clone https://github.com/lrslab/SLRanger.git
cd sample/

### 3. Operon prediction
`operon_predict.py` is designed to predict operons.
#### Command options
Available options can be viewed by running `operon_predict.py -h` in the command line.
